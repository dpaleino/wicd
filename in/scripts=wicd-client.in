The wicd-client script checks for the existence of this file to determine
whether it should warn the user before launching wicd-curses instead, in 
the event of the gui client being launched outside of the X Window environment.

If you delete this file, then wicd-client will print the warning if it is 
launched outside of X (and then recreate this file again).
